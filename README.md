## üß† How It Works

1. **User enters a query** like "Recommend me a romantic movie with Emma Stone."
2. **Chatbot processes** the query using NLP (spaCy/transformers).
3. The system **extracts metadata** (genre, actor, etc.) and fetches results from the database or TMDb API.
4. **Recommendations are ranked** using content-based filtering logic (cosine similarity on metadata vectors).
5. **Results are displayed** as expandable movie cards with interactive UI.
